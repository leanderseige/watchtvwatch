The Watch TV Watch uses the current date to determine whose turn it is to decide what the family will watch on TV tonight. It also has a button that triggers a random selection regardless of the current date. There are also rumors that the Watch TV Watch has a secret web interface to manipulate the final decision, but -- ssshht! -- maybe not everyone needs to know those technical details.
