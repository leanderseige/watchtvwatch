Who decides what we're going to watch on TV tonight? If this question sounds familar to you then this device is for you. This watch helps you and your family to determine who will decide what the family watches on TV tonight.

The Watch TV Watch uses the current date to determine whose turn it is to decide what the family will watch on TV tonight. It also has a button that triggers a random selection regardless of the current date. There are also rumors that the Watch TV Watch has a secret web interface to manipulate the final decision, but -- ssshht! -- maybe not everyone needs to know those technical details.

Please note the lovely clock hand! It was a quick design with tinkercad. I warmed it up a bit using a heat gun and pressed it onto the motor shaft ... et voil√†! The STL file is also available here.
